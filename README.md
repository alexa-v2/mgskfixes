# Magisk Fixes

## What's this?

This is a small collection of fixes for Magisk. Primarily targeting Motorola devices 
or GSIs. These may be useful in other situations

Admittedly you could move on to these files into place yourself but why would you?
You can do it systemlessly

If you still want to do it systemful just add `-sysover` to the end of the file name (when flashing in TWRP)

## So you're "fixing" Magisk with Magisk?

Yes! Magisk is by nature modular, making things simpler

## Where do I get support?

I highly recommend joining our telegram group [here](https://t.me/inlmagisk)

## Fix {x} is needed on my device

Join the supp group and let me know and I'll add it in
